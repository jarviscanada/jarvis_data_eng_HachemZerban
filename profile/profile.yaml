summary: I'm a bilingual IT professional with 2 years of hands-on experience in IT support. I'm result-driven able to work in a fast-paced environment and able to handle difficult situations. I have successfully developed organizational applications following design methodologies such as Agile, Waterfall development method, and Iterative model. I'm adaptable to work both independently and with team members. I believe being open-minded, focused, and consistent are the important aspects of a good team member.  As a successful software developer, I seek opportunities to practice and push myself a bit harder than yesterday to keep my skills sharp and refreshed. I always try to stay updated on the latest trends in technology by reading the latest technology news. My goal is to be able to use my best skills to build high-quality software  and  to focus on improving technical solutions that further establish organizational goals. I'm proficient in a range of modern technologies including Java, C#, and SQL. I also possess skills in Relational databases including Mysql, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
