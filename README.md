## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HachemZerban](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HachemZerban)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HachemZerban/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a monitoring tool for a cluster of servers to continuously record essential resource usage data as well as hardware specifications for each node and store the collected data on a database. I used  Linux Bash scripts, Docker, and PostgreSQL. The collected data will be used for further data analytics to balance the node's workload.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HachemZerban/tree/develop/core_java)]:
      
  - **Twitter App:** Allows a user to create, read, and delete tweets from the CLI using Twitter's REST API.
  - **JDBC App:** Developed a Java application to manage a relational database of a commercial website using Java, JDBC, PostgreSQL, Design Patterns, and Maven. The application implements the Data Access Object pattern to run CRUD   (create, read, update and delete ) operations on customer data and orders made by customers.
  - **Grep App:** Developed a  Java application that mirrors the Linux grep command functionality that enables users to search recursively through directories to find a text pattern and then store the search results in an output file. I used Java, Linux Bash, Regex, Maven, and Docker to build the app. 
  


## Highlighted Projects
**CSV File Manipulator**: Coded a program in **C** that manipulate heavy CSV files from the Ministry of education to extract valuable data like the average number of students enrolled in the computer science field. Generated sub-CSV files that encompass specific data like the list of Ph.D. computer science students in a specific region. Implemented different sorting algorithms like Quicksort and bubble sort to sort all records by age. Implemented a binary search algorithm to find certain records by using the first name. 

**Car Dealerships Database**: Designed tables for car dealerships and built complex queries using Joins and subqueries like returning a list of customers that bought a model in the last week. This helped to gain valuable data insights that will be used for further marketing strategies.  Technologies used include **Microsoft SQL SERVER** and **Transact SQL.**
